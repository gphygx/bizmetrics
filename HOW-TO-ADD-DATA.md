## üí° Pro Tips

### Don't Have All the Numbers?

**That's okay!** You can:
- Fill in what you have and leave the rest at $0
- Add more data later by clicking "Add Data" again with the same period
- The system will update your existing data for that period

### Entering Multiple Periods

To track trends over time:
1. Add data for 2023 (yearly)
2. Add data for 2024 (yearly)
3. Add data for 2024-Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 (quarterly)

**The dashboard will automatically:**
- Calculate period-over-period changes
- Show trend arrows (‚Üë improving, ‚Üì declining)
- Display historical charts when you expand the "Historical Trends" section

- Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Revenue) √ó 100%
- Gross Profit Margin = (Gross Profit / Revenue) √ó 100%
- Operating Margin = (Operating Income / Revenue) √ó 100%
- ROE = (Net Income / Equity) √ó 100%
- ROA = (Net Income / Assets) √ó 100%

**Liquidity Metrics:**
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
- Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Inventory Turnover = COGS / Average Inventory
- AR Turnover = Revenue / Average AR
- Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets

**Growth Metrics:**
- Revenue Growth = % change from previous period

## üóëÔ∏è Clearing Old Demo Data (If Needed)

**Good news:** New deployments using the latest seed file automatically start with a clean database (no demo financial data).

**If you deployed earlier and still see old demo data:**

**Option 1: Fresh Deployment (Recommended)**
```bash
# On your server
cd ~/bizmetrics
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose run --rm bizmetrics npm run db:push --force
docker compose up -d
```

This rebuilds everything with the latest clean seed.

**Option 2: Manual Database Clear**
```bash
# Connect to your server
ssh root@your-server-ip
cd ~/bizmetrics

# Clear financial data only (keeps user/company)
docker compose exec bizmetrics sh
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "DELETE FROM financial_data;"
exit
```

**Now add your own data using the form!**

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**Form won't save:**
- Check that you filled in at least the required fields (Period, Period Type)
- Make sure monetary values are numbers (no $, commas)
- Check browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

**Metrics showing $0 or N/A:**
- This means you haven't added data for that period yet
- Click "Add Data" and fill in your numbers

**Can't see the "Add Data" button:**
- Make sure you're logged in (use demo/demo123)
- Navigate to the "Financial Metrics" page
- The button is in the top-right corner next to the period selector

**Login issues:**
- Username is `demo` (not demo@company.com)
- Password is `demo123` (case sensitive)
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Check server logs: `docker compose logs bizmetrics`

**Getting validation errors:**
- All monetary fields accept decimal numbers (e.g., `1250000.50`)
- New Customers and Total Customers must be whole numbers (e.g., `125`)
- Period should match the Period Type format:
  - Yearly: `2024`
  - Quarterly: `2024-Q1`
  - Monthly: `2024-01`
